# VigenereCipher

From Wikipedia:

> " The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution." 

This is a small (and buggy) C++ implementations of the Vigenère Chiper. You can compile it using g++ and no particular flags. It takes three arguments: an input file, an output destination and the encryption key. In the future, I will change this because I want to give the possibility to use keys as long as the user wants (now it's not possible, you must use one-word length password).
